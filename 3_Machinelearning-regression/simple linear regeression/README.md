# Simple Linear Regression Hands-on project

## Introduction
This project implements object detection using the YOLOv3 model on the salary dataset. 

## Dataset
- This salary dataset contains two columns:'Years of Experience'	and 'Salary'

##Model Creation/Learning
- Data Collection
- Data Preprocessing
- Input/Output Split
- Split Train and Test Data
- Create model with Train Data
- Evaluate/Test model performance with the Test set
- Save the best model 

##Model deployment
1 - Creating the model (in jupyter notebook)
2 - Saving the model (using pickle, save the finalized model and perform pickle dump which will result in a .sav file) 
3 - Deploying the model (create new notebook to call on and open the saved model) 

## Evaluation Metric Results
- Achieved an r_score of 0.97 on the test set (interpretation - model performs very well as r is closer to 1)
