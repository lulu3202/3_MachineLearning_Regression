# General Notes on Regression 

## Introduction
This repo contains different types of regression models and a demonstration of how they work along with hands-on projects. Individual README files has been added for every type of model (that includes  dataset description, process and results discussion) 

## 1. Simple Linear Regression
- README file included as part of this folder for the hands-on project

## 2. Multiple Linear Regression
- README file included as part of this folder for the hands-on project

## 3. SVMR
